__**Rules**__
**1** - Be respectful.
_ _
Things we consider not being respectful:
    **1a** - Being an asshole. It's okay to joke around (even about dark subject matters), but if you hurt other people's feelings you're going too far. **[Yellow]**
    **1b** - Sexism/racism/homophobia/transphobia/any form of discrimination is strictly not allowed. This includes but is not limited to the use of slurs and their variations. Examples include ||Nigga, Faggot, Retard||. **[Red]**
    **1c** - If you have a problem with a member that doesn't concern the server -> DM exist. **[Green]**
    **1d** - Do not needlessly ping roles and do not abuse pingable roles. They should only be used when necessary and for their proper purpose. Alternatively, do not continuously ping a member if they've already told you they don't want to be pinged. **[Green]**
_ _
_ _
**2** - No nsfw content is allowed on this server outside nsfw channels. It is up to staff's discretion what counts as nsfw or not. If you are unsure if something is nsfw or not, check with someone before sending it to the server. Spoiler tagging something does not make it exempt from this rule. **[Yellow]**
_ _
_ _
**3** - When posting images or graphic descriptions that may be upsetting to some people (e.g. injuries), mark them as spoilers and add a warning. Also, If you send a GIF or video that has seizure inducing content, spoiler tag the GIF/video and give a warning beforehand. **[Yellow]**
_ _
_ _
**4** - Spoilers must be properly spoiler-tagged stating the series name and what season/episode the spoiler is from. This includes changes in character designs and events such as timeskips, character deaths, etc. in all channels.
__**Instructions on how to spoiler tag a message and image**__
_ _
Add \|\| around the text you would want to spoiler tag. For images, if you're on mobile, rename the image file that would start with SPOILER\_, for PC you have to mark it as a spoiler before sending it.
For example:
_ _
> Bakemonogatari E15 spoilers ||Hanekawa is best girl.||
_ _
This rule applies to games and books as well. **[Yellow]**
_ _
    **4a** - Do not intentionally spoil people. **[Black]**
_ _
_ _
**5** - Do not spam at all on this server. Spam can just be you sending 3 or more of the same messages (or variants). **[Green]**
_ _
_ _
**6** - Do not use untaggable usernames or have offensive nicknames. **[Green]**
_ _
Criteria for nicknames on the server:
_ _
- Either the username or the nickname is mentionable. If you have a username that is all special characters, you need a nickname that people can mention. If your username is easily mentionable, your nickname doesn't need to be.
_ _
- Your displayed name can't be obnoxiously long, containing unreadable characters or characters taking up half the screen.
_ _
_ _
**7** - Don't advertise, and if in doubt, ask a mod or admin. **[Green]**

_ _
**11** - If you are a staff member, do not abuse your power. **[Red]**

__**Additional Rules for <#794267549831135252>**__
_ _
**13** - Mudae is full of spoilers because of how it works so play at your own risk, but this isn't a reason to let loose:
_ _
    - Do not use spoiler images/aliases for your characters. If a staff member asks you to change it, do it. **[Green]**
_ _
_ _
**14** - Always uphold your end of a trade. **[Green]**
_ _
_ _
Breaking these rules may result in an exemption from participating and a reset of your progress.
_ _
_ _
_ _
__**Additional information**__
In cases where a warning is not warranted, or a warning by itself isn't enough, a staff member can mute members for a time period that they see fit, depending on the situation. Though, the member (in most cases) should have received a verbal warning beforehand. Members in some cases may not receive verbal warnings before a documented warning (e.g. Rule 8).
_ _
In some cases, you may be warned in situations where your actions did not necessarily break the rules in their worded form. In these cases, staff is allowed to deal with you how they see accordingly. This applies to cases where members may try to loophole themselves out of getting warnings.
If you believe you were wrongly warned, you may ask a staff member about your infraction, and if your argument is reasonable, the infraction may be removed, or further discussion may need to happen, in which case, the court channel will be used. This applies to bans too.
_ _
_ _
_ _
__**Warning System**__
_ _
This server uses a points-based warning system.
_ _
_ _
When a user reaches:
_ _
8 points: Kick and server muted for a week.
_ _
12 points: Member gets banned.
_ _
__**Bans**__
_ _
Different bans can happen depending on what type of rule a member breaks.
*these are all after a member gains 12 points*
_ _
- **Permanent** or **6 months** for [Black]    -> depending on staff discussion: rejoining with 10/12 points
- **6 months** for [Red]                                 -> rejoining with 6/12
- **4 months** for [Yellow]                            -> rejoining with 4/12
- **2 months** for [Green]                             -> rejoining with 2/12
_ _
The length of the ban corresponds to the rule broken that's worth the highest amount of points. (e.g. If someone gets 3 warnings, resulting in 12 points, from a combination of a [Green], [Yellow] and [Red] rule, they'll receive a temporary ban of 6 months with 6/12 points when they rejoin.)
_ _
**After being temporarily banned once, a second ban will result in a permanent ban.**
_ _
_ _
Points accumulate over time if a user breaks the rules, with the different categories having different values of points, as shown below. Points can be lowered over time, with 1 point going after every 30 days, provided the user does not accumulate any more points in that timeframe.
_ _
_ _
_ _
**Rules Categories**
_ _
Green: 2 points
_ _
Yellow: 4 points
_ _
Red: 6 points
_ _
Black: 12 points
